# Simplified-New-Tab

## Description

This project served as a test of the basic functionality required to build a chrome extension. I wanted to specifically replace the new tab page and remove the unneccessary elements from the page in addition to cycling through a selection of images. The minimalist look includes only the search bar to query google and no other extra elements to distract. An image is chosen from the files to display as the background, being randomly selected on each new page. This project is the starting point to building future chrome extensions and serves as a base for later projects.
